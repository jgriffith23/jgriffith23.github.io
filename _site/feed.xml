        <title>Templating and Interfacing Web Pages is Awesome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a whirlwind week of HTML, CSS, and Flask, I know roughly how to make web pages talk to each other. Woohoo! Definitely still have a lot to learn, though. I also hit some areas of programming that I just don’t grok intuitively, and grappling with them has been…interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a logical person. I like simplifying logic equations with De Morgan’s theorem and then building little systems to represent them with logic gates. I used to do those gridded logic puzzles on paper for fun, and I’m one of those weirdos who gets excited about stepping through programs with debuggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m also a creative person. I love writing, doodling, cross-stitching, watercolor painting, photography, and costuming. One of my favorite programming tools is Processing because I can use it to code art. I’ll take any excuse to combine crafting with LEDs, and I once made a color-changing scarf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I thought I’d fall madly in love with front-end development for some reason. It’s artistic and logical, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently I’m not as wired for design as I thought I might be, or maybe web design, in particular, isn’t the right kind of logical for me. While I can envision a pipeline of information going from one program to another to put words on a screen, I often cannot picture exactly how something I do in HTML or CSS will affect what those words look like. Sure, there’s a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; that this text is theoretically going to sit in, but don’t ask me where that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; sits on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s a matter of practice? Once I get into a good workflow and get a skeletal page put together, making the page pretty gets easier, but it just doesn’t flow yet. I’ll have to keep trying. Perhaps I’ll fiddle with my Liquid templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there are several areas of web development that I’m much more excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;interfacing-components&quot;&gt;Interfacing Components&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things got real at Hackbright when we started tinkering with a web framework called Flask. With Flask, you can use Python to make web pages talk to each other, and that feels amazing. For part of our homework this weekend, we built the bare beginnings of a simple web application, complete with form fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what a route to an HTML page on a website might look like in Flask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@app.route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;index_page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;Shows an index page.&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;index.html&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line is called a &lt;em&gt;decorator&lt;/em&gt;, which defines a route; in this case, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is the route being defined. The decorator syntax is a part of Flask, and if I’ve understood correctly, decorators actually represent some built-in function in the framework. The function after the decorator defines what should happen when someone accesses that route, say by clicking a hyperlink or submitting a form. Anyone accessing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; will be served the page written in &lt;em&gt;index.html&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find thinking about how best to link up pages on a website really fascinating, and debugging the connections can be a great puzzle to work through. (Debugging routes can also be frustrating–very frustrating. Working with Flask has reminded me of the value in just walking away for a little while.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;templating-all-the-things&quot;&gt;Templating All the Things&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been learning how to generate HTML pages with Jinja, a Python templating engine that you can interface with Flask. The idea is that you can create a base template (or multiple bases, if you like) with placeholders that Jinja understands, and other pages on your site can inherit the characteristics of the base template. Then, when you render pages in Flask, Jinja will fill in the blanks! Plus, if you link up your CSS stylesheet inside your base template, the styles will be automatically applied to all pages that inherit from the base. SO. COOL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple &lt;em&gt;base.html&lt;/em&gt; file might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgriffith23/jgriffith23.github.io/master/assets/jinja_base.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Jinja&quot; title=&quot;Jinja-fied Base Template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Liquid really wanted to read these Jinja blocks so I had to screenshot the code. If you like the colors I have going on here, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/&quot;&gt;Fairyfloss Sublime Text theme&lt;/a&gt; by the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sailorhg&quot;&gt;@sailorhg&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blocks do what they say on the tin. the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; block is a placeholder for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section of an HTML page, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; block is a placeholder for any &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; you might want to fill in, and so on. Jinja can also handle loops and if statements, and this code uses both to display any flash messages generated by the page previously visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this base file, you could make an HTML file like this one that extends it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgriffith23/jgriffith23.github.io/master/assets/jinja_extend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jinja&quot; title=&quot;Jinja-fied HTML Page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that lovely? It’s so much cleaner than cluttering your files with all the usual HTML tags, and it’s way more readable. Being able to supply content for those variables also lets you do really fun things, like templatizing (is that a word?) bulleted lists or tables as shown above. Just create a list of data in your Flask script, pass the list to Jinja when you render the template, and boom, you can throw down a ten-line table in half the HTML. Plus, you’ll never have to worry about adding extra lines manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation == &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;testing-debugging-and-documenting&quot;&gt;Testing, Debugging, and Documenting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, I’ve said it before. I’m into documentation, and testing with docstrings is awesome. We also learned about unit, integration, and functional testing in Python this week, though, and I just have to say, I’m looking forward to writing tests for my big project once I get started. I’m still not sure how I feel about the idea of test-driven development (I’ll have to try it at some point), but I see merit and sense in knowing how to write good tests. I’ll have to start using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unittest&lt;/code&gt; on my homework or maybe cook up a personal project to get some experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging Jinja/Flask code is a new and interesting experience, too, because you’re dealing with sets of data in a different formats. You have to make sure you’re passing Jinja data in a form it can use, so print statements are often extra helpful in Flask code. Just print data as you process it, and you’ll be able to track the variables you’re trying to pass to Jinja much more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flask’s debug toolbar is also quite helpful, and the Inspect tool in browser developer toolkits is all kinds of awesome. Yay, tools!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;knowing-how-and-why-systems-work&quot;&gt;Knowing How and Why Systems Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what I realized while I was thinking about everything I enjoyed about this week is that my favorite part of computer engineering is still knowing the how and the why of a system I’m creating or maintaining. I need to know why a system should work the way it does to begin to understand it. I like to know how pages communicate, and there’s no better way to know that than by routing the connections yourself. It’s also very satisfying to look at a block of text on a page and know exactly how certain pieces of it got from the user’s input to being displayed in the browser. One of our assignments this week taught us roughly how a shopping cart might work, using sessions, and it totally blew my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to be the one making pages pretty, though. Give me your gorgeous pages, tell me what data you want to display on them, and I’ll be happy to (try to) make them into a running web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quotes of the Post:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(On programming, generally):
“When you want to write a program, the last thing you should do is touch your keyboard. Plan first.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(On Flask/Jinja):
“Try to think backward from what your template needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;–Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Doodles for Comprehension</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t listen to lectures (or meetings, for that matter) without doodling if there’s a pen and paper in front of me. Writing things down is really helpful, though, and whenever I make a good doodle that embodies a new concept, I definitely remember it more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some folks thought these were cute, so I figured I’d share, in case anyone else would find them useful. (Concepts appear in no particular order.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;methods-vs-functions&quot;&gt;Methods vs Functions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our first few lectures on object-oriented programming. Talking about the differences between functions and methods inspired this little doodle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgriffith23/jgriffith23.github.io/master/assets/ListMethodsFunctions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Methods and Functions&quot; title=&quot;Methods and Functions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case the little characters didn’t get the point across, one way to remember when you’re using a method and when you’re using a function is if you can ask the object to do something to itself. In that case, you’re dealing with a method. If you’re asking Python to do something and passing the object as a parameter, you’re using a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;python-is-loosely-typed&quot;&gt;Python is Loosely Typed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from C-landia, this was one of the strangest things for me to grok about languages like Python. If I don’t tell you what my variable is, how will you know how much space to reserve? And why would I even want to change the type of my variable’s contents midway through a program? Ahhh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgriffith23/jgriffith23.github.io/master/assets/LooseTypes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Loosely Typed&quot; title=&quot;Loosely Typed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But everything seems to work out in the end. I can see now that it is possible to not know whether the user will give you a string or a number and not end up with a program that breaks–you just have to handle the input appropriately. I’ve also just come to accept and enjoy the fact that I don’t have to program in quite so rigid a structure as I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;for-good-style-and-sanity-dont-mix-tabs-and-spaces&quot;&gt;For Good Style and Sanity, Don’t Mix Tabs and Spaces&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Python, indentation matters. It’s the only way your code blocks get set apart from each other. Apparently, it’s typical for Python programs to use four spaces as the standard indent amount, rather than using a single tab. But whatever your code base uses, just don’t mix the two, or you’ll cause headaches for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgriffith23/jgriffith23.github.io/master/assets/tabs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tabs and Spaces&quot; title=&quot;Tabs and Spaces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing should actually explode, but people may get upset with you if their program goes sideways due to indentation errors because you started using tabs instead of spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dont-freak-out--try-it-out&quot;&gt;Don’t Freak Out–Try It Out!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite aspects of Python is the fact that you can just try something out when you’re not sure what it does. Confused about a method? Got a file full of classes and just want to play with them? Crack open that Python console and go to town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgriffith23/jgriffith23.github.io/master/assets/pythonspace.png&quot; alt=&quot;Python SPACE!!&quot; title=&quot;Now entering the Python space...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve really enjoyed using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bpython&lt;/code&gt; instead of the standard &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; program lately. It has tab completion and syntax highlighting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;still-stuck&quot;&gt;Still Stuck?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one of my personal favorites–if you’re still stuck after playing around in the console…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgriffith23/jgriffith23.github.io/master/assets/readthedocs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Read the Docs&quot; title=&quot;Read the Docs!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because dense as they are, they’re at least a good pivot for asking questions intelligently elsewhere, or finding a good tutorial on a particular use for a method, function, class, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Explaining Well</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last several days, I’ve been learning about and reaping the benefits of improving my ability to tell people just what the heck I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re never going to talk to a customer or a non-technical co-worker about something in your company’s code base, you’re still going to have to explain your work to &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;. That might be another member of your engineering team, someone using your program who you’ll never even meet, or yourself a few days later. Whoever that person is, they’ll thank you for communicating your intentions clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I’d put the experiences I’ve had with explaining code into four categories. One involves speaking out loud, and the others involve documenting something about code in writing. Each category I mention here also relates to a slightly different audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;describing-code-aloud&quot;&gt;Describing Code Aloud&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pair programming, the idea is that you’re constantly discussing what’s going on in your program out loud. Since you frequently switch who’s driving and who’s navigating, talking through each line together as you program is the best way to make sure both you and your partner know what everything does. Maybe you know exactly how a method you want to use works, but if your partner doesn’t understand it they’ll get confused. Simply describing that method to your partner can help you both think about the program more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vocal discussion can (often should) begin even before you start actually coding up a solution to a problem. Grab a pen and paper, and just write a plan in pseudocode. You might have one algorithm in mind while your partner sees the problem differently, and by talking about your ideas, you can find the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborators you see in person need to know what the program they’re helping to create does, but sometimes, programmers and other users you don’t interact with will need that information, too. You could keep all the details in your head and just Skype with the other person to get them up to speed, but documenting your code as you write it is much more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;writing-useful-docstrings-3&quot;&gt;Writing Useful Docstrings (&amp;lt;3)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew from the first docstring I saw that I wanted to learn how to write them well. A docstring is text surrounded by two lines containing three quotes, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;This is a docstring. Docstrings give a short summary of the thing being 
documented here.

More detailed explanations can go after a blank line.

You can include example code for Python to use to test your program, too, 
like this:

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; call_function(argument)
&quot;Put the expected output here! :)&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;This is some actual code that will execute.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thing about docstrings is that they generate documentation for you. Everything you put in a docstring appears in the Python console if someone calls &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;help()&lt;/code&gt; and passes the name of your function. So if you make a function called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;helpful_function()&lt;/code&gt; and include a docstring, a user could enter the following in the Python console to access your explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;helpful_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’d see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Help on function helpful_function in module __main__:

helpful_function()
    This is a function that does awesome stuff!

    It prints random cat pictures and gifs to make you smile.

    Expects files of the format:
    Cat Species | Image Type | Meme Preference | Number of Images
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code inside a docstring doesn’t get executed as part of your program. But if you include code after a Python prompt and show the output you expect in the docstring, Python can generate tests for you. You can set those tests up to run automatically any time you run that file, to help you debug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already found myself going back to the docstrings I’ve written to remember what my functions do at a high level, and I find the documentation from the output of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;help()&lt;/code&gt; pretty useful. When your docstrings have the right information, someone should be able to call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;help()&lt;/code&gt; to learn how to use your code without ever reading the source itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;commenting-all-the-things&quot;&gt;Commenting All the Things&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our labs, I’ve taken to commenting blocks of code as soon as I write them, which probably sounds tedious. In some ways it is annoying, especially if I’m excited about the program and just want to run it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But trying to explain part of a program as you write it is useful because it prompts you to really think about your own solution. You’re already elbows deep in the guts of this problem, and your brain will probably never understand the solution as well as it does at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m done commenting, I like to step through the block I wrote like a computer and read my comment again to see if everything really works as I think it does. If I’m collaborating with someone, this is often a point where if I’ve mixed something up, they’ll catch it whether I do or not, which helps us find bugs faster, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting as you go is extra useful when you have to leave your program for a while and come back to finish it later. I don’t know how many times I would’ve been scratching my head for trying to figure out what some line was doing without my own comments there to tell me. If I hadn’t been commenting as part of my workflow, adding comments several hours later would’ve been more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If docstrings are for people who don’t need to look at source code, comments are particularly important for anyone actually maintaining or collaborating on that source code. For instance, I’ve had TAs and pair programming partners come over to look at something I wrote without comments and get totally lost. But once I took a few minutes to comment the same block of code up (and style it a little better, with new lines between blocks for a clean progression of “ideas”), they were able to see where I was going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;writing-useful-commit-messages&quot;&gt;Writing (Useful) Commit Messages&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commiting code to Git with descriptive commit messages is like giving your future self a roadmap into your project’s development. At some point, you’re going to make a ton of changes, realize you should’ve taken that left turn at Albuquerque, and not remember how to get back there manually. But if your commit messages clearly explain what’s changed with each commit, you should be able to read the log and get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit messages don’t have to be novels, either; a single sentence (maybe two, or even just a few phrases) is usually enough. Keeping your messages short and to the point will probably encourage you to commit more often, too. Any time I notice that I have a lot to say in a commit, my last one didn’t happen recently enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our lecture slides linked to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1296/&quot;&gt;very amusing xkcd&lt;/a&gt; about how easy it is to slip into writing nonsense Git commit messages. I’ve been trying to remember to be descriptive in my commit messages (admittedly, that doesn’t always happen yet…) because I’ve also had moments when I couldn’t remember where I left off in a project, and the commit log was super helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, if someone’s following your project or collaborating with you, making sure they know how and why you made the changes you made can help them be consistent when adding code themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;explaining-regularly-can-teach-you-to-think-faster&quot;&gt;Explaining Regularly Can Teach You to Think Faster&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from getting better at explaining code in general, I think all of these situations are also helping me think faster on my feet. I tend to be very methodical in my thought processes, so if I try to just speak on the fly, I can trip myself up. (That’s why I love writing so much–it gives me more time to process my thoughts.) But I really feel that I’m starting to organize my thoughts more quickly, which is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quote of the Week:
“About half the bugs you’ll make in your life will be, “That thing is not what you thought it was!””
–Joel (Perhaps quoting someone else; I don’t recall.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Python Is Kind of Beautiful</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There. I said it: a programming language is beautiful. Now I’m one of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; people. I’m okay with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kidding aside, I really never thought I’d describe a programming language with that word. Assembly is appealing to me not because it’s elegant but because when you use it, you have to understand every single little step the computer is taking to make something happen. I find C appealing because while it abstracts away a lot, there’s still not much magic to it. Everything goes in a particular place, you have to manage memory carefully, and pointers are pretty cool. Of course, C also gives you enough rope to hang yourself, but hey–debugging is half the fun, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all that, I honestly wasn’t sure how much I’d like Python. I’ve always gotten a lot of satisfaction out of being able to see what’s going on under the hood and to understand what I’m seeing in a program. Python is growing on me, though. Being able to basically read your program like English without actually translating it to pseudocode is fantastic, and it makes Python a great option for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I learned a couple of really fascinating things this week that I wanted to jot down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;slices-are-cool&quot;&gt;Slices Are Cool&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of Python elements that I had trouble getting my head around before Hackbright. Slicing is one of those elements. When you slice a list, set, or tuple, you’re asking Python to give you the elements from one index up to but not including another. A slice looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example with actual values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;some_stuff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this code, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;some_stuff&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[1, 2]&lt;/code&gt;. When I first started messing with Python, I found the “up to but not including” part a little tricky. And don’t even get me started on stepping. Now, after some pair programming practice and a great homework assignment, I feel a lot more comfortable slicing things up, and I think the feature is pretty awesome. My favorite thing about slices is how Python always gives a simple, logical answer when you try to slice out of bounds. For instance, a line sort of like this appeared on one of our slides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:]&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This slice gives [].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; is an empty list. Rather than give an error, Python basically says, “You want the stuff from indices 42 and up? There is no index 99, so there are no elements. That means the list of stuff from those indices is empty.” Pretty neat, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other interesting slices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;a&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;b&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;c&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Gives [0, 1]  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Gives [3, 2, 1, 0]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Gives []&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing to note: In Python, you can have negative indices! They index from the end, where the last element in the list is at index -1. This gives you a super convenient way to work from the end of a list in Python, something that can be much more frustrating in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the first slice above gives the elements from indices 0 to -2. Since &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stuff[:-2]&lt;/code&gt; is 2, you end up with the first two elements. The second slice above shows how combining a negative start index with a negative step value can let you reverse the list. The third slice is another great example of Python’s logic at work. There’s nothing in this list from indices 10 up to but not including 20, so the slice just gives an empty list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;in-python-memory-actually-acts-like-a-box&quot;&gt;In Python, Memory Actually Acts Like a Box&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how I like to know what’s going on under the hood in a program? Well, one lecture this week was all about memory, so I was psyched. And I discovered that some memory-related aspects of Python don’t work like I expected them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take variables, for example. In other languages, if you assign a value to a variable and then assign a new value, the old value gets overwritten in memory, never to be heard from again. It seems like an efficient system, especially since you don’t necessarily need to implement garbage collection. (Disclaimer: I don’t pretend to know it actually is efficient.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But think about how that might work in the physical world. Say you’ve got a box with a d6 in it. You want to play D&amp;amp;D, so you want to put a d20 in the box instead. You take the d6 out, place the d20 inside, and put the d6 outside the box. The d6 doesn’t poof out of existence–the box just no longer contains it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how memory works in Python–it’s like a box. Boxes are a pretty standard metaphor for memory, but this is the first time I’ve seen a system that works so much like the classic metaphor in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists demonstrate the concept better, though. Say you’re looking at the following box:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;game_box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;d20&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;pencils&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;notepad&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;holy staff&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, your friend wants to ride to D&amp;amp;D with you, so you ask her to check the box to make sure she has everything. You might say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;our_box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;game_box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other languages, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;our_box&lt;/code&gt; would be a copy of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;game_box&lt;/code&gt;, and changing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;game_box&lt;/code&gt; wouldn’t affect &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;our_box&lt;/code&gt; at all. Not so in Python. All you’ve done is put another sharpie label on the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your friend says, “I’m an archer, so I want to bring my bow and arrows to help me get into character.” (You’re playing a cleric, hence the holy staff.) So, you add her bow and arrows to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;our_box&lt;/code&gt; so she can get totally in character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;our_box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;d20&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;pencils&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;notepad&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;holy staff&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;bow and arrows&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you and your friend are still looking at the same box, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;game_box&lt;/code&gt; should now include &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&#39;bow and arrows&#39;&lt;/code&gt; as well. I think Python 3 may have changed this, because it doesn’t work in the Python 3.4.3 Shell version of IDLE, but we’re using Python 2 at Hackbright, and that memory weirdness totally works there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole concept seemed so crazy to me at first, but once I started visualizing memory as a box that multiple people can look at, everything started making a lot more sense. It’s kind of an elegant way of handling rebinding values, and the analog to something in the physical world just works so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doodling visuals whenever I find a useful metaphor like this during lecture. Maybe I’ll draw those up and post them sometime…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Days In</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m two days into the engineering fellowship at &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackbrightacademy.com/&quot;&gt;Hackbright Academy&lt;/a&gt;, and while a lot of the computer science concepts have been overall a review, I’m still learning a ton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of my takeaways so far, in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pair-programming-is-the-best&quot;&gt;Pair Programming is The Best&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally. I can’t imagine a better way to solidify concepts than by using a pair programming system. I often tend to sketch solutions to problems at a high level and then dive into the code, but when you’re driving in a pair programming scenario, you can’t just try all the things. When you’re navigating, you have to collect your thoughts and explain them so that someone else can understand your reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair programming really teaches you to step back, read the requirements for a project, plan your algorithm accordingly, and step through the code as you go. You might not get everything right the first time, but that’s okay. Having another full set of brain cells on the project makes debugging and refactoring much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really looking forward to learning from my peers like this for the rest of the fellowship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-linux-command-line-is-amazing&quot;&gt;The Linux Command Line Is Amazing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t done much with Linux in years, but between my own dabblings with Python, revisiting &lt;em&gt;Hacking: The Art of Exploitation&lt;/em&gt;, and starting at Hackbright, I have a renwewed appreciation for the command line. It’s so much faster to just do everything from the keyboard that I’m starting to resent clicking icons a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-isnt-so-bad&quot;&gt;Git Isn’t So Bad&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I was intimidated by Git and GitHub before I started my freelance technical writing/editing work this summer. Using Git and GitHub for that helped ease me into version control, and while I’m still a little shaky at times whet it comes to getting things to GitHub, today’s lecture on Git won me over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pair programming partner and I managed to completely overwrite our awesome solution to the day’s lab challenge, seemingly with no way to get the original contents back. Fortunately, however, we’d committed our last working code file to our project repo. After entering a simple &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git reset --hard&lt;/code&gt; command, we were back in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;read-the-docs&quot;&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuck on a concept? Go to the docs. Man pages are great, the Python docs are really informative (if more than a little bit dense…I’m glad I have cheat sheets for syntax), and if those aren’t as helpful as you’d like, someone probably had your question on Stack Overflow already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned to just suck it up and read the docs ages ago, mostly when building circuits (the docs are the only way to learn how a chip works!), but I’m relearning the concept in full force at the moment. And hey, now I know how &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; work. Thanks, docs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;write-good-documentation&quot;&gt;Write Good Documentation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew this going in: I’ve edited plenty of programming books, and when I do code myself, I tend to comment things most of the time, especially when I’m learning a new language. But seriously, the only way you’re going to remember what your code does an hour from now when you come back to it (nevermind anyone else who needs to read it) is by commenting it up. To that end, I’m planning to make good use of docstrings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;taking-care-of-yourself-is-key&quot;&gt;Taking Care of Yourself is Key&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Day 1, I didn’t eat properly, I didn’t get enough sleep, and I felt…well, not great, at the end of the day. If you’re going to survive a bootcamp, you have to take care of yourself. Take time for breakfast, don’t skimp on lunch (include protein!), drink plenty of water, and if you know you’ll go stir crazy, take a walk during lunch break. And if you need a moment of alone time during lunch, take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;you-dont-need-your-devices&quot;&gt;You Don’t Need Your Devices&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting my phone on “Do Not Disturb” from 10 AM to 6 PM is kind of amazing. I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a less distracting, more productive day. The emails and social media notifications will still be there at the end of the day, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting my laptop away for all of the daylight hours is pretty amazing, too. I thought I’d go crazy not being able to take notes on my computer, but honestly, I’m staying much more engaged than I could if I had my computer on. (Okay, friends, you can say “I told you so” now. You know who you are.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s the end of tonight’s braindump. Time to get some sleep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

“And pair programming was hella chill.”

        <title>My First Post!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m testing out my new GitHub blog setup with Jekyll. Since I’m about to learn a ton of Python, let’s start with a little &lt;em&gt;Hello World&lt;/em&gt; program. It is tradition after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
