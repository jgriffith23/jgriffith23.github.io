Over the last several days, I've been learning about and reaping the benefits of improving my own ability to tell other people just what the heck I mean. 

Even if you're never going to talk to a customer or a non-technical co-worker about something in your company's code base, you're still going to have to explain your work to *someone*. That might be another member of your engineering team, someone using your program who you'll never even meet, or yourself a few days later. Whoever that person is, they'll thank you for being able to communicate your intentions clearly. 

Here are some of the places where I've found myself explaining code, and why I think mastering this skill is crucial.

# Explaining Concepts and Code

So far, I've encountered four primary scenarios for explaining code. One involves speaking out loud, and the others involve documenting something about code in writing. (Admittedly, I'm pretty good at writing, but writing for in-code documentation is a skill unto itself.) Each category I mention here also relates to a slightly different audience. 

## Talk About Your Code with Other Programmers

In pair programming, the idea is that you're constantly discussing what's going on in your code.
