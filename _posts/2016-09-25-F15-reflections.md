I'm officially a software engineer! No really, I have a certificate and everything.
And a sweet red graduation robe--er, hoodie.

(Also, let's not forget that I have a pretty awesome first project under my belt,
too. Have I pointed you to it yet? No?

## On Closing One Chapter

My Hackbright fellowship term ended last week, and I'm pretty sure 
[the song from the end credits of *Wreck it Ralph*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU4JeBJL7JY) 
is the best way to describe how I feel. I've made so many amazing friends in the last
three months that it's hard to comprehend that I'm not going to see all of them
every day anymore! 

Seriously, this group of incredibly smart, driven, talented, generally wonderful 
women became like a family to me. We have this insane shared experience of soaking up
as much knowledge about software engineering as we could over the course of 12 weeks,
and for me at least, I can't imagine a better group to have gone through it with. 
Each person in my cohort inspired me in some way to strive to become a better engineer. 
Seeing their projects at the end of the course blew me away in terms of tech and 
creativity, and I'm still so proud just thinking of everything they accomplished. 

Fellow Adas, you taught me so much; thank you. We did the thing. It was hard, but 
we made it to the end, and our new journies are only just beginning. I can't wait 
to see what you do next, because I know it'll be epic.

## Thoughts on Career Weeks

Since I've touched on several bits of the Hackbright curriculum in some way over the last few
months, I'd be remiss if I didn't say something about weeks 11 and 12 in my last
"in progress" reflection post. Now that I've got the sentimental bit written,
here are some of my impressions on those less programming-heavy pieces.

The last couple weeks of each fellowship are focused on career development. That 
means lots of whiteboarding practice (both with Hackbright staff and at partner 
company offices), interview practice, and interesting speakers. 

I was only able to whiteboard with the ed staff, but they were all very encouraging,
and just being exposed to possible interview questions was helpful. We also had a
chance to work through some more complex "coding challenge" type puzzles (the kind
you might receive as a take-home challenge), which I found fascinating.

The talks I saw were helpful to varying extents. A few stick out in particular
in my memory:

* **Seema Ullal's Git presentation.** I wish I'd seen this before doing my first 
hackathon, but at the same time, I don't think I would have appreciated Seema's 
awesome tips and explanations as much without experiencing the struggle of Git 
collaboration firsthand. I definitely want to try out her setup suggestions and 
play with hooks.
* **Sharon Wienbar's equity talk.** Sharon is the CEO of Hackbright, and she's just such an 
inspiration that I think I would have loved any talk she gave. I didn't know much 
about equity going in, but her lecture clarified quite a few things. I know I'll 
refer back to it someday. Thanks, Sharon!
* **Robert Slifka's lecture on interviewing companies.** The questions he suggested 
asking here made a lot of sense and offered a great framework for getting the info 
you need in an interview.
* **Ian Chan's technical interview talk.** Entertaining and informative! Ian made technical 
interviews feel a little less scary by breaking them down into their component parts.

Ultimately, I'd suggest any future Hackbright student try to make it to Hackbright
during as many of these events as possible. If you wind up not wanting to watch a 
talk, you'll at least be in the building with other students. You can grab a lab 
and practice whiteboarding, work on code challenges, or even work on your next 
project. Make as much use of the Hackbright space and time structure while they're 
available to you regularly.

## Starting a New Journey
We're all setting out on new adventures, and I've actually found a clear path to 
follow, at least for a while: I'm now a teaching assisstant at Hackbright! Though
seeing a whole new cohort in the space my group called home for three months is
a bit crazy, I'm really psyched about this opportunity. I have a chance to dig
further into Python and explore areas of software engineering that I'm excited about,
and I get to teach while I do it. I've always had fun explaining things and seeing people
have those "aha" moments; I've only been at it regularly for a few days, but helping 
other women learn for even that long has already brought me so much joy.

I still plan to go into industry, and when I do, I'll have an even deeper understanding
of software engineering. Until then, I'm going to have fun teaching and learning,
dive down all the rabbit holes, and keep writing here.
