Hi, I'm Jennifer. I have a degree in [electrical engineering](http://www.ece.ufl.edu/), I spent several years [editing technical books](https://www.nostarch.com), and for a while, I was a freelance technical editor and writer. 

I still enjoy writing and editing, but since graduating from [Hackbright Academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/), I've changed careers. Now, I'm a software engineer and teaching assistant at Hackbright. I still like building hardware stuff, too; I'm just much better at programming these days, and I can also build webapps.

I started this GitHub blog to document my experiences at Hackbright. Post-graduation, I'm using it for several things:

* Reflect on experiences and concepts I learn in software engineering (probably also the odd bit on hardware)
* Practice HTML, CSS, Git, and Markdown
* Keep my writing skills (both technical and non-technical) fresh

When I'm not coding or editing, you can find me poking at stuff with a multimeter (or sonic screwdriver) or on a crafting adventure involving LEDs and thread. I play board games, card games, and video games; tend to devour manga and scifi; and love hiking.

Allons-y!
