Hi, I'm Jennifer. I have a degree in [electrical engineering](http://www.ece.ufl.edu/), I spent several years [editing technical books](https://www.nostarch.com), and until recently, I was a freelance technical editor and writer.

I'm currently a student at [Hackbright Academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/), where I'm learning the skills to be a software engineer. I've built robots and designed PCBs, but the Web and the applications that live on it have always been something of a mystery to me, so I'm psyched to be at Hackbright.

My plan is to use this GitHub blog to do several things:

* Reflect on my experiences at Hackbright
* Practice HTML, CSS, and Markdown
* Keep my writing skills (both technical and non-technical) fresh

When I'm not coding or editing, you can probably find me poking at stuff with a multimeter (or sonic screwdriver), trying to break something, or on a crafting adventure involving LEDs and thread. 

Allons-y!
